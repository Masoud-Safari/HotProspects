# HotProspects: Conference Connection Tool

## Introduction

HotProspects is a SwiftUI app designed to enhance networking opportunities at conferences. It enables users to share their attendee information via QR codes and collect details from others to build a list of contacts for future follow-up. This project was an exploration into several key iOS development concepts, including SwiftUI for the user interface, Core Image and AVFoundation for QR code generation and scanning, UserNotifications for local notifications, and data persistence using the SwiftData.

## Project Description

### What the App Does

- **Functionality:** The app displays a user’s QR code containing their contact information, which other attendees can scan to add to their list of contacts. Users can manage their contacts within the app, categorizing them into 'contacted' and 'uncontacted' lists for efficient follow-up. Additionally, the app provides the ability to receive notifications for reminders.
- **Technologies Used:** HotProspects is built with SwiftUI for its user interface, leveraging Core Image and AVFoundation for QR code generation and scanning capabilities. It utilizes UserNotifications for delivering timely reminders and notifications, and integrates SwiftData for robust data persistence.

### Purpose and Learning

- **Objective:** The goal of HotProspects was to create a practical tool for conference attendees to facilitate networking and contact management. The project served as an avenue to delve into QR code technology, understand SwiftUI’s capabilities in a real-world application, and implement effective data storage solutions.
- **Challenges and Solutions:** 
  - **QR Code Integration:** Integrating QR code generation and scanning posed a challenge, requiring a combination of Core Image and AVFoundation. I navigated these frameworks to implement a seamless QR code experience within the app.
  - **Data Persistence:** Implementing data persistence with SwiftData was crucial for managing contacts over time. Learning SwiftData’s API allowed for efficient storage and retrieval of contact information, ensuring user data was safely managed and easily accessible.
- **Skills Gained:** This project broadened my knowledge of SwiftUI and introduced me to working with QR codes, local notifications, and data persistence. It honed my skills in creating intuitive and user-friendly interfaces, and deepened my understanding of modern data storage techniques in iOS development.
